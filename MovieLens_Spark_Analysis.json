Insights and Explanations\r\n\r\nThis section provides a detailed summary of the main findings and analytical reasoning throughout the MovieLens 100k dataset exploration. Each analysis step yields important insights about user behavior and movie characteristics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Calculating the Average Rating for Each Movie\r\n\r\nBy aggregating ratings across all users, I calculated the average rating and the total number of ratings for each movie.  \r\nThis process gives a clear picture of which movies are consistently favored or disfavored by the user base.  \r\nMovies with a high number of ratings and a stable average rating are likely to have broad appeal or cultural significance.  \r\nConversely, movies with fewer ratings may represent niche interests or less popular genres.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Identifying the Top Ten Movies with the Highest Average Ratings\r\n\r\nFocusing on movies with at least 50 ratings, I identified the top ten movies with the highest average scores.  \r\nThis threshold ensures the rankings are not biased by a small number of extreme ratings.  \r\nMost top-ranked movies are either highly acclaimed classics or widely recognized by audiences.  \r\nThis finding demonstrates that collective user ratings can reliably highlight high-quality or iconic films.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Active Users and Their Favourite Genres\r\n\r\nI filtered users who have rated at least 50 movies, labeling them as active or highly engaged users.  \r\nFor each of these users, I counted the number of ratings they gave in each genre, and then determined their most frequently rated (favourite) genre.\r\n\r\nInsights include:\r\n- Many active users consistently favor a specific genre, such as \"Drama\" or \"Action\".\r\n- Some users have diverse interests, but still show a clear genre preference.\r\n- The distribution of favorite genres among active users reflects overall audience tastes and possible trends in movie popularity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Users Less Than 20 Years Old\r\n\r\nBy selecting users under the age of 20, I explored the demographic composition and behaviors of the youngest segment of the dataset.  \r\nMost of these young users are students, with a relatively balanced distribution of genders.  \r\nUnderstanding the preferences and activities of this age group can help with targeted recommendations or youth-focused analyses.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5. Users Who Are Scientists Aged 30-40\r\n\r\nI applied a combined filter on both occupation and age to identify all users listed as \"scientist\" and aged between 30 and 40.  \r\nThis targeted filtering uncovers a specific professional demographic within the user base.  \r\nAlthough only a small number of users meet these criteria, such focused subgroup analyses can be valuable for custom marketing strategies or understanding niche user groups.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### General Observations\r\n\r\n- The MovieLens dataset contains a diverse set of users with varied demographic backgrounds and movie preferences.\r\n- SQL and Spark operations enable powerful filtering and aggregation, making it possible to answer both broad and highly specific analytical questions.\r\n- By combining multiple filters (such as age, occupation, and activity level), I can perform in-depth segmentation to support recommendations, marketing, or sociological research.\r\n- Overall, data-driven exploration of movie ratings and user information reveals patterns in collective opinion, individual tastes, and demographic behaviors.\r\n\r\n","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2025-06-13T15:54:27+0000","config":{"colWidth":12,"enabled":true,"results":{},"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true},"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1749830048498_-1760085546","id":"20250613-155408_834050747","dateCreated":"2025-06-13T15:54:08+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"focus":true,"$$hashKey":"object:97412","dateFinished":"2025-06-13T15:54:27+0000","dateStarted":"2025-06-13T15:54:27+0000","results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<h2>Insights and Explanations</h2>\n<p>This section provides a detailed summary of the main findings and analytical reasoning throughout the MovieLens 100k dataset exploration.

Users Less Than 20 Years Old</h3>\n<p>By selecting users under the age of 20, I explored the demographic composition and behaviors of the youngest segment of the dataset.\n<br  />Most of these young users are students, with a relatively balanced distribution of genders.\n<br  />Understanding the preferences and activities of this age group can help with targeted recommendations or youth-focused analyses.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>5. Users Who Are Scientists Aged 30-40</h3>\n<p>I applied a combined filter on both occupation and age to identify all users listed as &ldquo;scientist&rdquo; and aged between 30 and 40.\n<br  />This targeted filtering uncovers a specific professional demographic within the user base.\n<br  />Although only a small number of users meet these criteria, such focused subgroup analyses can be valuable for custom marketing strategies or understanding niche user groups.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>General Observations</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The MovieLens dataset contains a diverse set of users with varied demographic backgrounds and movie preferences.</li>\n<li>SQL and Spark operations enable powerful filtering and aggregation, making it possible to answer both broad and highly specific analytical questions.</li>\n<li>By combining multiple filters (such as age, occupation, and activity level), I can perform in-depth segmentation to support recommendations, marketing, or sociological research.</li>\n<li>Overall, data-driven exploration of movie ratings and user information reveals patterns in collective opinion, individual tastes, and demographic behaviors.</li>\n</ul>\n"}]}},{"text":"%md\n## Recommendations\n\nBased on the analysis of the MovieLens 100k dataset and the key insights obtained from each step, I propose the following recommendations for future work, platform design, and research directions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Improve Recommendation Systems with Popularity and Stability\n\nSince movies with a high number of ratings and a stable average score generally reflect broad audience appeal, I recommend giving these movies more weight in collaborative filtering and popularity-based recommendation algorithms.  \nAdditionally, highlighting consistently popular movies can increase user satisfaction, especially for new or undecided users.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Adjust Genre Recommendations According to User Activity\n\nThe analysis shows that highly active users tend to have clear genre preferences.  \nI recommend personalizing genre-based recommendations for these users, prioritizing their most frequently rated genres.  \nFor less active users, a diverse mix of genres may help them discover their specific interests.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Create Demographic-Specific Features and Marketing\n\nGiven the significant presence of young users (especially students under 20), I suggest developing youth-oriented features or movie collections (e.g., \"Top Picks for Students\" or \"Movies for Young Audiences\").  \nSimilarly, targeting users based on occupation (such as scientists or other professionals) can support niche content curation and specialized marketing campaigns.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Encourage Engagement among Inactive or New Users\n\nMost high-engagement users contribute significantly to rating diversity and overall platform activity.  \nTo cultivate more active users, I recommend providing incentives for rating more movies, such as gamified achievements, badges, or personalized rewards for users who reach certain rating milestones.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Ensure Fairness in Ratings and Rankings\n\nTo avoid biases caused by a small number of ratings, always apply a minimum rating count threshold when displaying average scores or generating \"top movie\" lists.  \nThis approach ensures fairer and more reliable recommendations.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Enable Deeper User Segmentation for Advanced Analytics\n\nThe ability to filter by age, occupation, and other user attributes is powerful for research and platform optimization.  \nI recommend maintaining and possibly expanding user profile fields, enabling even finer segmentation and targeted feature development in the future.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Continue Data Quality Checks and Enrichment\n\nThe analysis relies on the completeness and accuracy of user and movie metadata.  \nI recommend routine data quality audits and, if possible, enriching the dataset with additional information such as more detailed genre tags, user watch history, or explicit feedback on recommendations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nImplementing these recommendations can improve the user experience, increase engagement, and allow for more precise movie suggestions and platform growth. Continuous data analysis should be a standard practice to adapt to evolving user interests and behaviors.\n","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2025-06-13T15:59:25+0000","config":{"colWidth":12,"enabled":true,"results":{},"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true},"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1749711926939_1615413122","id":"20250612-070526_92965248","dateCreated":"2025-06-12T07:05:26+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:92827","dateFinished":"2025-06-13T15:59:25+0000","dateStarted":"2025-06-13T15:59:25+0000","results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<p>Based on the analysis of the MovieLens 100k dataset and the key insights obtained from each step, I propose the following recommendations for future work, platform design, and research directions:</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>1.
